# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
Ace Supermarket is a mall that is currently in debt and has realized that sales must grow to boost revenue.
To increase sales, they want to campaign targeted ads at top-buying customers. Their definition of top-buying customers is an individual with a higher annual income than the average and a higher spending score than three-fourths of the databaseâ€™s total spending score.
Additionally, they added that getting the gender, age, annual income, and spending income of such customers will be instrumental to them in the final proposal we come up with. From the requirements specified, it is evident the segmentation to be performed on this challenge will be demographic segmentation.
The main dataset sent by the mall to make predictions from has 5 columns namely; CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
